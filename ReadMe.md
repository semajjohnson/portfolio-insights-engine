Data Pipeline Overview
This project ingests open-source market data using the Yahoo Finance API (yfinance) for a configurable list of tickers. Raw historical price data is programmatically extracted, cleaned, and normalized using pandas to enforce a consistent schema where each row represents a single ticker on a single trading date. Cleaned datasets are written to disk with automated, date-based filenames and then loaded into a SQLite database for persistent storage. A composite primary key on (ticker, date) ensures data integrity and prevents duplicate records. Downstream analysis queries the database to compute portfolio metrics such as holdings, portfolio value, and performance over time. The pipeline is modular by design, allowing data sources, storage backends, or analytical layers to be extended without restructuring the core workflow.
